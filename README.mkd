This is my resume. Use [pandoc][1] to compile it into html.

```bash
# Assuming you're on Ubuntu, otherwise you'd probably know how to (google how
# to) install pandoc on your system of choice.
sudo apt-get install pandoc
pandoc -s index.mkd -o html/index.html -c style.css -t html5
```

To push to GitHub Pages:

```bash
sudo pip install ghp-import
ghp-import -p -n html
```
